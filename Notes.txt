Some notes regarding the web service:
1) The webservice is not fully implemented as mentioned in the problem statement.
2) The fully implemented endpoints are
    2.1 Create a new animal shelter "POST /api/v1/animal_shelters"
    2.2 Retrieve animals of a shelter "GET /api/v1/animal_shelters/{id}/animals"
    2.3 Delete an existing animal shelter "DELETE /api/v1/animal_shelters/:id"
3) Not all database constraints are added. I focused more on designing the web service interface. The models and migrations in the project have minimal fields and few constraints. This is not completed.
4) I wrote some integration tests before using Swagger so I kept them commented in the source code for a reference. It is my first time to use Swagger as well.
5) The code is not fully refactored. Some code can be shared specially for handling errors. I just implemented the basic stuff with acceptable code version from my point of view but extra refactoring can be done for the actual web service.
6) The solution is implemented using Rails 5.2 API mode and Ruby 2.5.0
7) I only added swagger for two endpoints which I fully implemented not for all because of time limit.
